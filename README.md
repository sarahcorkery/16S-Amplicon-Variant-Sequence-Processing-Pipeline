# 16S-Amplicon-Variant-Sequence-Processing-Pipeline
The following a pipeline processing 16S amplicon variant sequence (ASV) data. The DADA2 portion of this script will allow us to process amplicon sequencing data to identify and quantify ASVs. The latter portion of this script uses PHYLOSEQ to visualize the relative abundance of our processed amplicon sequencing data.
